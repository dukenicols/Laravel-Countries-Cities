World Countries & Cities
========================

A Laravel package for using world's popular countries and cities.

## Supports

- Laravel 5.5+

## Features

- Add the countries/cities to the database using migration and seeders.
- Use the countries/cities directly from the package without using the database.

## Installation

Require the package with composer:
```
composer require Dukenicols/world-countries-cities
```

The ServiceProvider will be added to the providers array in config/app.php through
auto-discovery

## Usage

### Migration

After running `php artisan vendor:publish` you can directly run:
```
php artisan migrate
```

### Seeders
In order to seed the migrated tables, you need to edit `database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php` and add the following lines:
```php
public function run()
{
    Model::unguard();

    $this->call('Dukenicols\WorldCountriesCities\CitiesSeeder');
    $this->call('Dukenicols\WorldCountriesCities\CountriesSeeder');
}
```

Then run:
```
php artisan db:seed
```

Be careful, the seeders files truncate the tables before inserting, to prevent any duplication.

### Direct usage

To be implementated.
